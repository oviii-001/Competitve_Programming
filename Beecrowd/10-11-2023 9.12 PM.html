<p>My name is Ovi. I'm from department of Software Engineering at Daffodil International University. I love to coding. Recently I've started web developing. I am learning HTML,CSS and JavaScript. I've started with HTML. After completing to learn HTML then I'll learn CSS. And then JavaScript. JavaScript is a website making language. 90% websites are made by JavaScript. JavaScript is a preferable language for website making. I also learned C language. C language is quite hard but if you are dedicate to learn prongramming language then you can break this hardness. But you have to start with C language. Because C language is mother language of others. After learning C language you call shift any languages easily.</p>
